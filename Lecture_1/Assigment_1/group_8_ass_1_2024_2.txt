My favorite song

FERNANDO MENDOZA - "Space Oddity" - David Bowie

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Commencing countdown, engines on
    Check ignition and may God's love be with you

    Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Lift off

    This is Ground Control to Major Tom
    You've really made the grade
    And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
    Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

    This is Major Tom to Ground Control
    I'm stepping through the door
    And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
    And the stars look very different today

    For here
    Am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do

    Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
    I'm feeling very still
    And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
    Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you...

    Here am I floating round my tin can
    Far above the Moon
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do


Elisa Vivar - "Magia" - Gustavo Cerati

Tal vez parece que me pierdo en el camino
Pero me guía la intuición
Nada me importa más que hacer el recorrido
Más que saber adonde voy
No trates de persuadirme
Voy a seguir en esto
Sé, nunca falla
Hoy, el viento sopla a mi favor
Voy a seguir haciéndolo
Las cosas brillantes siempre salen de repente
Como la geometría de una flor
Oh
Es la palabra antes que tus labios la suelten
Sin secretos no hay amor
Todo me sirve, nada se pierde, yo lo transformo
Sé, nunca falla, el universo está mi favor
Y es tan mágico
Voy a seguir haciéndolo
Me sirve cualquier pretexto
Cualquier excusa, cualquier error
Oh, oh, oh


LUCIA BASAGOITIA - "Diamonds" - Sam Smith

Have it all
Rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothing to me anymore
But to you
They were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for (mm)
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care
My diamonds leave with you
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here I can breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
Shake it off
Shake the fear of feeling lost
Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lie-lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care
My diamonds leave with you
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here I can breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you
Always knew, my diamonds leave with you
Always knew
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here I can breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you, oh
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways (oh-oh)
Baby, you're so cruel (so cruel)
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here I can breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you
