Raúl Amao
Té para tres - Gustavo Cerati

Las tazas sobre el mantel
La lluvia derramada
Un poco de miel
Un poco de miel
No basta
El eclipse no fue parcial
Y cegó nuestras miradas
Te vi que llorabas
Te vi que llorabas
Por él
Té para tres
Un sorbo de distracción
Buscando descifrarnos
No hay nada mejor
No hay nada mejor
Que casa

Lessons in love
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

Lost without love

Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn

Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (lessons in love)
Lessons in love

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better (could be better), should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love
