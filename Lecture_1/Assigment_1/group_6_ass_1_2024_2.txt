My favorite song

NATALIA FIGUEROA - What was I made for?

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just something you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday I might
Someday I might
Think I forgot how to be happy
Something I'm not, but something I can be
Something I wait for
Something I'm made for
Something I'm made for

Javier Flores - Small Bump

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes
